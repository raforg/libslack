libslack - A UNIX/C library of general utilities for programmers with Slack

    Slack(n.): The state in which you need nothing,
               because you already have it.
                     -- Dobbs, 1956

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~
Libslack is a library of general utilities designed to make UNIX/C programming
a bit easier on the eye. It is a seemingly random collection of modules and
functions that I find commonly useful. 

It's a small library with lots of functionality, accurately documented and
thoroughly tested. Good library naming conventions are not rigorously observed
on the principle that common operations should always be easy to write and code
should always be easy to read.

Libslack contains the following modules:

    agent    - agent oriented programming
    coproc   - coprocess using pipes or pseudo terminals
    daemon   - becoming a daemon
    err      - message/error/debug/verbosity/alert messaging
    fio      - fifo and file control and some I/O
    getopt   - GNU getopt_long() for systems that don't have it
    hsort    - generic heap sort
    lim      - POSIX.1 limits convenience functions
    link     - abstract linked lists with optional growable free lists
    list     - list (growable pointer array) data type
    locker   - abstract locking and reader/writer lock implementation
    map      - map (hash table) data type
    mem      - memory helper functions, secure memory, memory pools
    msg      - message handling and syslog helper functions
    net      - network functions (clients/servers, expect/send, pack/unpack, mail)
    prog     - program framework and flexible command line option handling
    prop     - program properties files
    pseudo   - pseudo terminals
    sig      - ISO C compliant signal handling
    snprintf - safe sprintf for systems that don't have it
    str      - string data type (tr, regex, regsub, fmt, trim, lc, uc, ...)
    vsscanf  - sscanf() with va_list argument for systems that don't have it

INSTALL
~~~~~~~
Currently, this is only known to work on the following systems:

    Linux Redhat 6.x/7.x
    Solaris 2.6
    OpenBSD 2.9

Compiling on Solaris 2.6 requires running conf/solaris-cc (If you have the
Sun WorkShop C compiler) or conf/solaris-gcc (If you have gcc) in the source
directory. Compiling on OpenBSD 2.9 requires running conf/openbsd. It is
ready to compile on Linux as distributed so it is not necessary to run
conf/linux. There isn't a real configure script yet so you will no doubt
encounter problems on other systems. An ISO C and POSIX/XPG4 environment
will help greatly.

If your system doesn't have snprintf(3), GNU getopt_long(3), vsscanf(3),
strcasecmp(3), strncasecmp(3), strlcpy(3) or strlcat(3), uncomment the
relevant lines in the libslack/config.h file to include them in libslack.

If your system doesn't have POSIX 1003.2 compliant regex functions, or they
are buggy, either: install the GNU implementation,
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/regex/regex-0.12.tar.gz [290K]
(doesn't support internationalisation);
or install Henry Spencer's implementation,
ftp://ftp.zoo.toronto.edu/pub/regex.shar [157K].

If you really, really, really don't want the regular expression functions,
uncomment HAVE_REGEX_H in libslack/config.h to enable the rest of the str
module to be compiled.

If you have a linux-2.2.x system, you must have LinuxThreads-0.8 or
LinuxThreads-0.9 and the latest corresponding version of glibc.
If you have a linux-2.4.x system, you must have at least glibc-2.2.1
and glibc-linuxthreads-2.2.1. They are available from
http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/glibc/. Older versions can be used but
they are buggy and I don't want to hear about it.

First, uninstall any previous version:

    cd libslack-0.4
    make uninstall

To build and test:

    tar xzf libslack-0.5.tar.gz
    cd libslack-0.5
    conf/<your-system>   # if applicable (i.e. solaris-[g]cc, openbsd)
    make
    make test

To install libslack and its manpages (into /usr/local by default):

    make install

To install into somewhere other than /usr/local:

    make PREFIX=/opt/libslack install

To uninstall:

    make uninstall

For more details:

    make help

There is one manpage for each module in libslack (as well as one for each
function). The module manpages are agent(3), coproc(3), daemon(3), err(3),
fio(3), hsort(3), lim(3), link(3), list(3), locker(3), map(3), mem(3), msg(3),
net(3), prog(3), prop(3), pseudo(3), sig(3) and str(3). If necessary, the
manpages getopt(3), snprintf(3) and vsscanf(3) are created as well.

BINARY PACKAGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install from the RPM binary package (into /usr by default):

    rpm -i libslack-0.5-1.i386.rpm

To install from the RPM binary package into somewhere other than /usr:

    rpm --prefix=/usr/local -i libslack-0.5-1.i386.rpm

To install from the (relocatable) Debian binary package (into /usr):

    dpkg -i libslack_0.5_i386.deb

To install from the (relocatable) Solaris binary package (into /opt/libslack):

    gunzip libslack-0.5.sun4u.pkg.gz
    pkgadd -d libslack-0.5.sun4u.pkg

Install from the OpenBSD binary package (into /usr/local):

	pkg_add libslack-0.5-obsd-i386.tar.gz

REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Requires perl to run the scripts in the conf directory.
Repuires perl to install per-function manpage links.
Requires an ISO C compiler like gcc to compile the source.
Requires pod2man (comes with perl) to make the manpages.
Requires pod2html (comes with perl) to make the html manpages.
Requires POSIX 1003.2 compliant regex functions. See INSTALL.
Requires libpthread. See INSTALL.

PLATFORM NOTES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Linux
~~~~~
Linux 2.2 always returns 0.0.0.0 on getsockopt(IP_MULTICAST_IF) so
net_multicast_get_interface() always returns 0 under Linux 2.2. Linux 2.4
does not have this bug.

Make sure you have a recent glibc (at least 2.1.3) and libpthread (at least
0.8) (See INSTALL).

Linux 2.2 and 2.4 have a bug in poll(2). It always times out 10ms later than
specified. Libslack corrects for this as best as it can (if > 10ms -= 10ms)
but it's not good enough when you need timers with a granularity of 10ms. In
this case, you have to use agent_create_with_select() instead of
agent_create() under Linux because select() doesn't have this bug. However,
scalable I/O is impossible with select(). So, if you need timers with a
granularity of 10ms *and* scalable I/O, you need an agent that uses select()
in one thread for the timers and separate agents that use poll() in other
threads for the I/O.

Solaris
~~~~~~~
Solaris (at least 2.6 and 2.7) doesn't return the hardware address or index
of network interfaces from ioctl() with a SIOCGIFINDEX command argument.
Libslack fills in the index in net_interfaces().

UNIX domain datagram sockets aren't supported very nicely. An actual
filesystem entry is needed for the client and it must be unlinked after use.
It's also possible for a malicious local user to deny a client access to the
server. The solution is to always use UNIX domain stream sockets.

Solaris 2.6 has an inadequate snprintf() function so libslack provides it's
own implementation. When configured for Solaris, this snprintf() function
will behave exactly like the system's snprintf() function, even though it
has incorrect behaviour with respect to the ISO C standard. I thought this
was better than having thousands of module tests apparently "fail".

OpenBSD
~~~~~~~
Has the same UNIX domain datagram socket problem as Solaris.
