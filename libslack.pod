=head1 DESCRIPTION

Libslack is a library of general utilities designed to make UNIX/C programming
a bit easier on the eye. It is a seemingly random collection of modules and
functions that I find commonly useful.

It's a small library with lots of functionality, accurately documented and
thoroughly tested. Good library naming conventions are not rigorously observed
on the principle that common operations should always be easy to write and code
should always be easy to read.

=head1 FEATURES

=over 4

=item Program Framework

The "framework" parts of I<libslack> are bound to be the most objectionable.
Nobody likes frameworks. Don't worry, there isn't much to it. If you don't
like it, pretend it's not there. 

I<Libslack> provides the ability for programs to identify themselves,
perform command line option processing in a single line of code and produce
"standard" GNU style C<--help>, C<--version> and usage messages. Debug and
verbose messaging is also provided and is enabled by the use of "standard"
C<--debug> and C<--verbose> command line options. 

Messages (including error, debug and verbose messages) are provided with
clean call syntax and flexible semantics. Messages can be directed to log
files, file descriptors, syslog or multiplexed to any of the above (and to
anywhere else (e.g. dialog boxes) if you implement your own message
handlers) without complicating the call syntax. 

ISO C imposes extreme restrictions on signal handlers. POSIX imposes less
extreme but still annoying restrictions. I<Libslack> contains functions that
provide a level of abstraction between the signal handlers that you write
and the real (ISO C compliant) signal handlers. This allows you to write
unrestricted signal handlers. 

Coarse grained persistence of simple configuration information is provided
by the use of Java style properties files in "well-known" locations.

=item Daemon Services

I<Libslack> provides functions that make writing daemons trivial. It
includes functions to become a daemon and to optionally create a locked pid
file to ensure that only a single instance of a named daemon is ever active
at the same time. The daemon function behaves appropriately if the client
process is started by I<init(8)> or I<inetd(8)>. There are also functions to
streamline the parsing of simple configuration files (like those commonly
found in the C</etc> directory). There are also functions that help you
write more secure daemons (i.e. revoke setuid/setgid privileges, prevent
core file generation, change user and group, test the safety of a given file
path).

=item Network Services

I<Libslack> provides functions to simplify the implementation of network
servers and clients (TCP, UDP, unicast and multicast) and the (text or
binary) application protocols that they use. Network servers and clients can
be setup in a single line of code. There is transparent support for IPv4,
IPv6 and UNIX domain socket addresses. There is support for reliability over
UDP. Text protocols are implemented by sequences of expect and send
functions. Binary protocol packets can be packed and unpacked (using
functions similar to I<pack()> and I<unpack()> in I<Perl> but
network/storage friendly). There's also a function to send mail.

=item Agent Oriented Programming

I<Libslack> provides a generic agent oriented programming model in the form
of the I<Agent> data type. Like objects, agents can react to external
stimuli. Unlike objects, agents can can also take independent actions. This
is performed by multiplexing I/O events on arbitrary file descriptors using
I<poll()> or I<select()> and also multiplexing timers for scheduling
actions. Connecting and disconnecting file descriptors is done in constant
time. Scheduling and cancelling actions is done in constant time. Timer
maintenance is performed in constant average time. This means that agents
are scalable with respect to the number of outstanding timers and can
support thousands of scheduled actions. A single agent may be used like a
simple event loop, or multiple agents can be connected to each other in
arbitrary networks across multiple threads, processes and/or hosts. A single
agent isn't scalable with respect to the number of connected descriptors but
multiple agents can be combined to achieve much higher scalability.
They're useful for networked applications, distributed systems and
simulations.

=item Data Types

I<Libslack> provides a generic growable pointer array data type called
I<List>, a generic growable hash table data type called I<Map> and a decent
I<String> data type that comes with heaps of functions (many lifted from
I<Perl>). There are also abstract singly and doubly linked list data types
with optional, "growable" freelists.

=item Decoupled Thread Safety

I<Libslack> provides the I<Locker> data type which decouples thread
synchronisation strategies from client code. This allows code to be written
that delegates the choice of synchronisation strategy to the client. This
enables run time selection of locking strategies which means it's even
possible to let the end user specify which locking strategy to use. It
supports mutual exclusion locks, readers/writer locks and no locking. There
are also debug versions that print messages to standard output to help
clients locate deadlocks. See
L<http://raf.org/papers/mt-disciplined.html|http://raf.org/papers/mt-disciplined.html>.

=item Miscellaneous

I<Libslack> contains convenience/shorthand functions for random things such
as reading a line of text with any line ending (UNIX, DOS or Macintosh),
fifo and file control, retrieving POSIX.1 limits, parsing syslog
facility/priority pairs, dynamic allocation of multi-dimensional arrays,
memory pools, secure memory, secure memory pools, There's also a heap sort
function. And there are also implementations of GNU I<getopt_long()>,
I<strlcat()>, I<strlcpy()>, I<snprintf()>, I<vsnprintf()>, I<vsscanf()>,
I<asprinf()> and I<vasprintf()> for systems that don't have them. There are
also functions for creating pseudo terminals portably and for creating
coprocesses that use either pipes or pseudo terminals for communication with
the client process.
