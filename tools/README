This directory contains several utilities. Most of them are only useful
to me during development. The last might be useful to libslack users.

The following four perl scripts help to guarantee that at least the formal
parts of the libslack documentation accurately reflect the code. The first
checks that the function prototypes that will appear in the DESCRIPTION
sections of each module's manpage exactly matches the header of the function
itself. The second checks that the typedefs and function prototypes in the
header files exactly match the same information in the SYNOPSIS section of
the corresponding module's manpage. The third checks that the function
prototypes in each header file exactly matches the function prototypes in the
DESCRIPTION section of the corresponding module's manpage. Together, these
three scripts guarantee that the typedefs and function prototypes in the
manpages match the header files and the source code. The fourth combines
the above checks.

    check-pod-prototypes.pl # check description = source
    check-pod-header.pl     # check header = description
    check-pod-synopsis.pl   # check synopsis = header
    check-pod               # check source = description = header = synopsis

There's a butchered version of Html.pm that I use to generate the HTML
versions of the documentation. It is used by pod2html. The original version
tries to make hyperlinks to things that it shouldn't because it assumes that
the POD being converted into HTML is a perl related manpage. The assumptions
that it makes are wrong for C library manpages.

There's a script to help me maintain the stupid configuration files at least
until I start using autoconf.

    viconf

The final script reads the output of the debug lockers defined in the
locker module and shows where any deadlocks have occurred.
