=head1 NAME

I<getopt> - Parse command line options

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #include <unistd.h>

    int getopt(int argc, char * const argv[],
        const char *optstring);

    extern char *optarg;
    extern int optind, opterr, optopt;

    #include <slack/getopt.h>

    int getopt_long(int argc, char * const argv[],
        const char *optstring, const struct option *longopts,
        int *longindex);

    int getopt_long_only(int argc, char * const argv[],
        const char *optstring, const struct option *longopts,
        int *longindex);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The I<getopt()> function parses the command line arguments.  Its arguments
C<argc> and C<argv> are the argument count and array as passed to the
I<main()> function on program invocation.
An element of C<argv> that starts with `-' (and is not exactly "-" or "--")
is an option element.  The characters of this element
(aside from the initial `-') are option characters.  If I<getopt()>
is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of the option characters
from each of the option elements.

If I<getopt()> finds another option character, it returns that
character, updating the external variable C<optind> and a static
variable C<nextchar> so that the next call to I<getopt()> can
resume the scan with the following option character or
C<argv>-element.

If there are no more option characters, I<getopt()> returns
C<EOF>. Then C<optind> is the index in C<argv> of the first
C<argv>-element that is not an option.

C<optstring> is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
If such a character is followed by a colon, the option requires an argument,
so I<getopt> places a pointer to the following text in the same
C<argv>-element, or the text of the following C<argv>-element, in
C<optarg>. Two colons mean an option takes an optional arg; if there
is text in the current C<argv>-element, it is returned in C<optarg>,
otherwise C<optarg> is set to zero. This is a GNU extension. If
C<optstring> contains C<W> followed by a semicolon, then
C<-W foo> is treated as the long option C<--foo>.
(The C<-W> option is reserved by POSIX.2 for implementation extensions.)
This behaviour is a GNU extension, not available with libraries before
GNU libc 2.

By default, I<getopt()> permutes the contents of C<argv> as it
scans, so that eventually all the non-options are at the end. Two
other modes are also implemented.  If the first character of
C<optstring> is `+' or the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is
set, then option processing stops as soon as a non-option argument is
encountered.  If the first character of C<optstring> is `-', then
each non-option C<argv>-element is handled as if it were the argument of
an option with character code 1.  (This is used by programs that were
written to expect options and other C<argv>-elements in any order
and that care about the ordering of the two.)
The special argument `--' forces an end of option-scanning regardless
of the scanning mode.

If I<getopt()> does not recognize an option character, it prints an
error message to stderr, stores the character in C<optopt>, and
returns `?'.  The calling program may prevent the error message by
setting C<opterr> to 0.

The I<getopt_long()> function works like I<getopt()>
except that it also accepts long options, started out by two dashes.
Long option names may be abbreviated if the abbreviation is
unique or is an exact match for some defined option. A long option
may take a parameter, of the form C<--arg=param> or C<--arg param>.

C<longopts> is a pointer to the first element of an array of
C<struct option> declared in C<getopt.h> as

    struct option {
        const char *name;
        int has_arg;
        int *flag;
        int val;
    };

The meanings of the different fields are:

=over 4

=item C<name>

is the name of the long option.

=item C<has_arg>

is:
C<no_argument> (or 0) if the option does not take an argument,
C<required_argument> (or 1) if the option requires an argument, or
C<optional_argument> (or 2) if the option takes an optional argument.

=item C<flag>

specifies how results are returned for a long option.  If C<flag>
is C<NULL>, then I<getopt_long()> returns C<val>. (For example,
the calling program may set C<val> to the equivalent short
option character.)  Otherwise, I<getopt_long()> returns 0, and
C<flag> points to a variable which is set to C<val> if the
option is found, but left unchanged if the option is not found.

=item I<val>

is the value to return, or to load into the variable pointed
to by C<flag>.

=back

The last element of the array has to be filled with zeroes.

If C<longindex> is not C<NULL>, it points to a variable which is
set to the index of the long option relative to C<longopts>.

I<getopt_long_only()> is like C<getopt_long()>, but `-' as well
as `--' can indicate a long option.  If an option that starts with `-'
(not `--') doesn't match a long option, but does match a short option,
it is parsed as a short option instead.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

The I<getopt()> function returns the option character if the option was found
successfully, `:' if there was a missing parameter for one of the options,
`?' for an unknown option character, or C<EOF> for the end of the option list.

I<getopt_long()> and I<getopt_long_only()> also return the option
character when a short option is recognized.  For a long option, they
return C<val> if C<flag> is C<NULL>, and 0 otherwise.  Error and C<EOF>
returns are the same as for I<getopt()>, plus `?' for an ambiguous match
or an extraneous parameter.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over 4

=item C<POSIXLY_CORRECT>

If this is set, then option processing stops as soon as a non-option
argument is encountered.

=item C<_>I<PID>C<_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_>

This variable was used by I<bash> 2.0 to communicate to GNU libc which
arguments are the results of wildcard expansion and so should not be
considered as options. This behaviour was removed in I<bash> version 2.01,
but the support remains in GNU libc.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE

The following example program, from the source code, illustrates the
use of I<getopt_long()> with most of its features.

    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int
    main (argc, argv)
         int argc;
         char **argv;
    {
      int c;
      int digit_optind = 0;
    
      while (1)
        {
          int this_option_optind = optind ? optind : 1;
          int option_index = 0;
          static struct option long_options[] =
          {
            {"add", 1, 0, 0},
            {"append", 0, 0, 0},
            {"delete", 1, 0, 0},
            {"verbose", 0, 0, 0},
            {"create", 1, 0, 'c'},
            {"file", 1, 0, 0},
            {0, 0, 0, 0}
          };
    
          c = getopt_long (argc, argv, "abc:d:012",
    		       long_options, &option_index);
          if (c == -1)
    	break;
    
          switch (c)
            {
            case 0:
              printf ("option %s", long_options[option_index].name);
              if (optarg)
                printf (" with arg %s", optarg);
              printf ("\\n");
              break;
    
            case '0':
            case '1':
            case '2':
              if (digit_optind != 0 && digit_optind != this_option_optind)
                printf ("digits occur in two different argv-elements.\\n");
              digit_optind = this_option_optind;
              printf ("option %c\\n", c);
              break;
    
            case 'a':
              printf ("option a\\n");
              break;
    
            case 'b':
              printf ("option b\\n");
              break;
    
            case 'c':
              printf ("option c with value `%s'\\n", optarg);
              break;
    
            case 'd':
              printf ("option d with value `%s'\\n", optarg);
              break;
    
            case '?':
              break;
    
            default:
              printf ("?? getopt returned character code 0%o ??\\n", c);
            }
        }
    
      if (optind < argc)
        {
          printf ("non-option ARGV-elements: ");
          while (optind < argc)
          printf ("%s ", argv[optind++]);
          printf ("\\n");
        }
    
      exit (0);
    }

=head1 BUGS

This manpage is confusing.

The POSIX.2 specification of I<getopt()> has a technical
error described in POSIX.2 Interpretation 150. The GNU
implementation (and probably all other implementations)
implements the correct behaviour rather than that speci-
fied.

=head1 CONFORMING TO

=over 4

=item I<getopt()>:

POSIX.2, provided the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.
Otherwise, the elements of C<argv> aren't really const, because we
permute them. We pretend they`re const in the prototype to be
compatible with other systems.

   This mode of operation is selected by either setting the environment
   variable POSIXLY_CORRECT, or using `+' as the first character

/* Scan elements of ARGV (whose length is ARGC) for option characters
   given in OPTSTRING.

   If an element of ARGV starts with '-', and is not exactly "-" or "--",
   then it is an option element.  The characters of this element
   (aside from the initial '-') are option characters.  If `getopt'
   is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of the option characters
   from each of the option elements.

   If `getopt' finds another option character, it returns that character,
   updating `optind' and `nextchar' so that the next call to `getopt' can
   resume the scan with the following option character or ARGV-element.

   If there are no more option characters, `getopt' returns -1.
   Then `optind' is the index in ARGV of the first ARGV-element
   that is not an option.  (The ARGV-elements have been permuted
   so that those that are not options now come last.)

   OPTSTRING is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
   If an option character is seen that is not listed in OPTSTRING,
   return '?' after printing an error message.  If you set `opterr' to
   zero, the error message is suppressed but we still return '?'.

   If a char in OPTSTRING is followed by a colon, that means it wants an arg,
   so the following text in the same ARGV-element, or the text of the following
   ARGV-element, is returned in `optarg'.  Two colons mean an option that
   wants an optional arg; if there is text in the current ARGV-element,
   it is returned in `optarg', otherwise `optarg' is set to zero.

   If OPTSTRING starts with `-' or `+', it requests different methods of
   handling the non-option ARGV-elements.
   See the comments about RETURN_IN_ORDER and REQUIRE_ORDER, above.

   Long-named options begin with `--' instead of `-'.
   Their names may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unique
   or is an exact match for some defined option.  If they have an
   argument, it follows the option name in the same ARGV-element, separated
   from the option name by a `=', or else the in next ARGV-element.
   When `getopt' finds a long-named option, it returns 0 if that option's
   `flag' field is nonzero, the value of the option's `val' field
   if the `flag' field is zero.

   The elements of ARGV aren't really const, because we permute them.
   But we pretend they're const in the prototype to be compatible
   with other systems.

   LONGOPTS is a vector of `struct option' terminated by an
   element containing a name which is zero.

   LONGIND returns the index in LONGOPT of the long-named option found.
   It is only valid when a long-named option has been found by the most
   recent call.

   If LONG_ONLY is nonzero, '-' as well as '--' can introduce
   long-named options.  */
